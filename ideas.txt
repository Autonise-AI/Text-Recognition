Not a single part of a letter should be out of the bounding box
Not a single part of a letter of other word shoul be inside the bounding box
Rotated text should be centered by breaking it down into smaller rectangles an then rotating and aligning

Removing background can be achieved using - 

Edge detection?
Segmentation + CRF

Step by step pipeline

Segmentation
Blurring
Unblurring
Recognition ??

Dataset generation using GANs

Thinking till now - 

Segmentation + Feature generation using UNet -> generating bounding box using UNet(PixelLink) -> LSTM on features generated with UNet to give output as text
features outside bounding box should be zero

Not a single part of a letter should be out of the bounding box - Does not matter now - Convolution is able to take care of missing some parts as has reception field
Not a single part of a letter of other word shoul be inside the bounding box - Does not matter now - Convolution in UNet has granularity to ignore outer noise
Rotated text should be centered by breaking it down into smaller rectangles an then rotating and aligning - No idea how to do it

Removing background can be achieved using - Segmentation + CRF


Segmentation - 

Do not need to use max pool. Too much loss in resolution. 

Use FCCNN, with skip connections and 1by1 convolutions.
Use skip connections directly to the output - 1 convolution layer after dot producting with the same layer extra output



Final Idea - 

Segmentation using UNet
Instance segmentation using PixelLink
Supervised Attention for text-recognition
Combined training

Document - 1000 images using GUI
Get detection and recognition F-Score on the standard datasets
Get baseline Google results on the standard dataset

Done

Ablation Studies - With or without link, with/without hard negative mining combination of the two
Â 
Add hog features in input

remove all max pool or some max pools from resnet
Multiresolution for training and testing - Actual, Acutal/2, Actual*2
Change the values of r(weightage of different loss functions) in hard negative mining
Predict boundary and subtract from output and then find contours

text reco - aspect resize
Find a way to add blanks to distinguish multiple words to improve detection accuracy
train_r on output of detection model, blank output means no detection

Think about how to errode stray links (Morphological image processing)









Too much resolution is being lost in resizing
Links are not breaking anything. Is there problem in finding connected components or whether links are being predicted wrongly?
Change to DenseNet
